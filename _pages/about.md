- I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee), working under the supervision of Prof. [YIN Zhen-Yu](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/people/academic-staff/prof-zhen-yu-yin). I earned my PhD from Wuhan University in 2022 under the mentorship of Prof. [LIU Yong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O6MLOGQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I was also a visiting PhD at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) under Prof. [LEE Fook-Hou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hEHH6sYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra), a fellow of the Singapore Academy of Engineering.

- My work is particularly recognized in the field of artificial ground freezing (AGF), where I have developed advanced thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) models for freezing processes in complex geological environments. This research earned me the 2023 Hubei Provincial Science & Technology Progress Award.

- I have published over 30 papers in leading international journals, with over 700 citations and an h-index of 15. I also serve as an Early-career Editorial Panel Member for the European Journal of Soil Science and regularly review for top-tier journals such as the Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering and Computers and Geotechnics.

- **My research interests involve**:  
   1. *Multi-field coupling theory*  
   2. *Constitutive modelling of soils*  
   3. *Random finite element method*  
   4. *Geotechnical risk and reliability*  
   5. *Uncertainty quantification and propagation*  
   6. *Machine learning in geotechnical engineering*
