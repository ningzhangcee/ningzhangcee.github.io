<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University(https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee), working under the supervision of Prof. YIN Zhen-Yu((https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/people/academic-staff/prof-zhen-yu-yin)). I earned my Ph.D. from Wuhan University in 2022, under the mentorship of Prof. [LIU Yong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O6MLOGQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and completed a visiting PhD at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) under Prof. [LEE Fook-Hou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hEHH6sYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra), a fellow of the Singapore Academy of Engineering. 
  
My research interests involve:
	Multi-field coupling theory
	Constitutive modelling of soils
	Random finite element method
	Geotechnical risk and reliability
	Uncertainty quantification and propagation
	Machine learning in geotechnical engineering

My work is particularly recognized in the field of artificial ground freezing (AGF), where I have developed advanced thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) models for freezing processes in complex geological environments. This research earned me the 2023 Hubei Provincial Science & Technology Progress Award.

I have published over 30 papers in leading international journals, with more than 700 citations and an h-index of 15. I also serve as an Early-career Editorial Panel Member for the European Journal of Soil Science and regularly review for top-tier journals such as the Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering and Computers and Geotechnics.
