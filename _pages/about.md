<p style="text-align: justify;">
Dr. LI Kaiqi is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where she works under the supervision of Prof. YIN Zhen-Yu. She earned her Ph.D. from Wuhan University in 2022, under the mentorship of Prof. LIU Yong. During her Ph.D., Dr. LI further expanded her expertise as a visiting researcher at the National University of Singapore, collaborating with renowned scholar Prof. LEE Fook-Hou, a fellow of the Singapore Academy of Engineering.
Dr. LI's research spans a wide range of cutting-edge topics in geotechnical engineering, with a particular focus on multi-field coupling theory, geotechnical risk and reliability, constitutive modeling of soils, and the application of machine learning in geotechnics. She is especially recognized for her pioneering work in artificial ground freezing (AGF), where she has developed advanced thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) models to simulate freezing processes in complex geological conditions. Her research has significant practical implications, particularly for underground construction and infrastructure in cold regions. Her distinguished research on AGF was also awarded “2023 Hubei Provincial Science & Technology Progress Award”
In addition to her technical expertise, Dr. LI has demonstrated a strong capacity for interdisciplinary research, integrating machine learning and uncertainty quantification into geotechnical modeling, which has led to breakthroughs in predictive modeling and decision-making under uncertain conditions. She has also played a key role in several high-impact research grants, including projects funded by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong, National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and NRF-NSFC 3rd Joint Research Grant.
Dr. LI has has published over 20 first-author papers in leading international journals, including several Highly Cited Papers. Her work has garnered over 700 citations, and she boasts an h-index of 15. Notably, she has been recognized as an Early-career Editorial Panel Member for the European Journal of Soil Science and has served as an invited reviewer for prestigious journals such as Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering and Computers and Geotechnics.
Dr. LI is also active in the academic community, contributing as an organizing committee member and co-chair of international symposiums such as the International Symposium on Innovations in Geotechnical Engineering towards Sustainability (IGES 2023) and the IACMAG 2025. Her leadership and innovative research have earned her several prestigious awards, including the PolyU Distinguished PDF Award, Centrally Funded Postdoctoral Fellowship, Top 10 Academic Star, and 2023 Academic Innovation Award.
