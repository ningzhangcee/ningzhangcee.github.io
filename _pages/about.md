<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/), working under the supervision of Prof. [YIN Zhen-Yu](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/people/academic-staff/prof-zhen-yu-yin/). I earned my PhD from Wuhan University in 2022, under the mentorship of Prof. [LIU Yong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O6MLOGQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and completed a visiting research stint at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) under Prof. [LEE Fook-Hou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hEHH6sYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra).
  
My research focuses on geotechnical engineering, with expertise in multi-field coupling theory, geotechnical risk analysis, constitutive modeling of soils, and the application of machine learning in geotechnics. I am particularly known for my work in artificial ground freezing (AGF), where I have developed advanced thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) models for freezing processes in complex geological environments. This work earned me 2023 Hubei Provincial Science & Technology Progress Award.

I have published over 30 papers in leading international journals, with more than 700 citations and an h-index of 15. Additionally, I serve as an Early-career Editorial Panel Member for the [European Journal of Soil Science](https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/13652389/editorialboard.html) and regularly review for top journals such as the Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering and Computers and Geotechnics.
