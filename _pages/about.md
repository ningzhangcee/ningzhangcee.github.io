<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at 
  <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee" target="_blank">The Hong Kong Polytechnic University</a>, 
  working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.polyu.edu.hk/cee/people/academic-staff/prof-zhen-yu-yin" target="_blank">Prof. YIN Zhen-Yu</a>. 
  I earned my Ph.D. from Wuhan University in 2022, under the mentorship of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O6MLOGQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN" target="_blank">Prof. LIU Yong</a>, 
  and completed a visiting PhD at the 
  <a href="https://nus.edu.sg" target="_blank">National University of Singapore</a> under <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/lee-fook-hou-3/" target="_blank">Prof. LEE Fook-Hou</a>, 
  a fellow of the Singapore Academy of Engineering.
  
* My research interests involve:
	Multi-field coupling theory
	Constitutive modelling of soils
	Random finite element method
	Geotechnical risk and reliability
	Uncertainty quantification and propagation
	Machine learning in geotechnical engineering

* My work is particularly recognized in the field of artificial ground freezing (AGF), where I have developed advanced thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) models for freezing processes in complex geological environments. This research earned me the 2023 Hubei Provincial Science & Technology Progress Award.

* I have published over 30 papers in leading international journals, with more than 700 citations and an h-index of 15. I also serve as an Early-career Editorial Panel Member for the <a href="https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/13652389/editorialboard.html" target="_blank">European Journal of Soil Science</a> and regularly review for top-tier journals such as the Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering and Computers and Geotechnics.
