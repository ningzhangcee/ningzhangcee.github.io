<p style="text-align: justify;">
	I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, working under the supervision of Prof. YIN Zhen-Yu. I earned my Ph.D. from Wuhan University in 2022, under the mentorship of Prof. LIU Yong, and completed a visiting research stint at the National University of Singapore under Prof. LEE Fook-Hou. I hold a B.E. in Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering from Northwest A&F University.
	My research focuses on geotechnical engineering, with expertise in multi-field coupling theory, geotechnical risk analysis, constitutive modeling of soils, and the application of machine learning in geotechnics. I am particularly known for my work in artificial ground freezing (AGF), where I have developed advanced thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) models for freezing processes in complex geological environments. This work earned me the 2023 Hubei Provincial Science & Technology Progress Award.
	I have published over 30 papers in leading international journals, with more than 700 citations and an h-index of 15. Additionally, I serve as an Early-career Editorial Panel Member for the European Journal of Soil Science and regularly review for top journals such as the Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering and Computers and Geotechnics.
